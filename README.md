Test cases to practice on Drupal 9

Test case 1:

Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to develop a small Drupal application with one custom module that
collects event registrations for the annual company wide AUSY family event.
Every year, AUSY organizes a family event for all employees and their plus one and kids. The employees
should be able to register for this event in a user friendly way. To prevent letting one person handle all
registrations, every department has its own manager responsible for the registrations of his/her
department. The department will have to be captured when submitting the registration form along with
the preferences for the event.

Guidelines
The project should be a Drupal 9 instance able to run on PHP 7 / MySQL 5.7+.
Make sure you have a working development environment with a standard Drupal 9 installation running.
Make sure the project is set up as recommended at Drupal.org and prevent uploading code that can be
fetched by a package manager.
Usage of contributed modules is only allowed where specifically mentioned.
Try to finish as much as you can, in the same order as the needed functionality is described in this
document. However, do not spend too much time on parts of the assignment you do not know how to
solve. Don’t worry about fully completing the test.
You can spend 4 hours on this test, according to the timeslot that was agreed upon. The exact
requirements will be sent to you at the start of the timeslot. After the three hours have passed you need
to mail the code to us.
Certain aspects necessary to make the module production-ready are not explicitly described in the
assignment. It's up to the implementer to think about these, while applying best practices in the
following areas:
● Drupal coding standards and naming conventions:

● Security: https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/security/writing-secure-code-for-drupal-8
● Internationalization and localization ...
